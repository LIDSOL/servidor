# This script checks the status of the upstream Debian mirror.
# Specifically, it checks the status file in the project/trace/
# directory in the upstream mirror and in the local mirror,
# and checks the following conditions:
#
# - If the pull from upstream mirror is less than 2 hours old,
#   then the mirror is considered up-to-date, and no action is taken.
# - If the pull from upstream mirror is older than 2 hours old, and
#   the local mirror is older than the upstream mirror, then a new
#   pull is initiated.
# - If the pull from upstream mirror is older than 2 hours old, and
#   the local mirror is newer than the upstream mirror, then the
#   local mirror is considered up-to-date, and no action is taken.
#
# This script is intended to be run repeatedly by a cron job or
# a systemd timer.
